### Mission Statement Section
**Section Label:** [ OUR MISSION ]

**Quote:**
"Our mission is to combine conservation work with real community collaboration and development in the provinces of Papua. Our ecosystems can only thrive in the long-term, if people have a chance to prosper too."
— West Papua Care

**Description:**
We're establishing a community-led No-Take Zone Marine Protected Area that benefits both marine ecosystems and neighboring fishing communities by boosting fish populations through spillover, securing food resources, enhancing ecotourism potential, and strengthening climate resilience through healthy habitats.

---

### Our Approach Section
**Section Label:** [ OUR APPROACH ]

**Title:** Community-Led Conservation

**Subtitle:** Traditional Governance Meets Modern Science

**Community Ownership**
- Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) protocols
- MPA Committee with traditional leaders, fishers, women's groups
- Minimum 30% women/youth representation
- Integration of customary law (adat) with modern MPA regulations
- Traditional closure areas (sasi) within no-take zone design

**Science-Based Protection**
- 250 km² no-take zone following international best practices
- Quarterly monitoring using standardized Reef Check protocols
- GPS-marked survey sites for long-term data collection
- IUCN Red List species identification and conservation tracking
- Partnership with local universities and research institutions

**Community Benefits**
- Spillover effects increasing fish catches in adjacent fishing areas
- Sustainable tourism opportunities through community-based guiding
- Alternative livelihood development reducing fishing pressure
- Strengthened traditional governance creating social capital

### The Challenge Section
**Section Label:** [ THE CHALLENGE ]

**Title:** Why This Matters

**Subtitle:** Critical Threats

**Biodiversity Under Pressure**
Raja Ampat hosts 75% of all known coral species but faces increasing fishing pressure threatening this irreplaceable ecosystem

**Destructive Practices**
Cyanide fishing, blast fishing, shark finning, and turtle poaching continue to devastate reef ecosystems and marine life

**Weakening Traditional Systems**
Loss of traditional management systems (sasi) is weakening community resource governance that protected these waters for generations

**External Illegal Fishing**
Illegal fishing from neighboring islands threatens biodiversity hotspots and local community livelihoods

**The Opportunity:**
Located in the global epicenter of marine biodiversity with the highest fish species richness on Earth, the Misool region represents a critical habitat for threatened species including Napoleon wrasse, Hawksbill and Green sea turtles, Bumphead parrotfish, and reef sharks.

With strong community consensus and traditional leader endorsement secured, we have a window of opportunity to protect this irreplaceable ecosystem before it's too late.

## ABOUT PAGE

### Hero Section
**Section Label:** OUR STORY

**Title:** Rooted in Community, Driven by Science

**Subtitle:** Building a new model for marine conservation that empowers local communities and protects the world's most biodiverse reefs

---

### Our Story
West Papua Care was founded on the belief that effective conservation must go hand-in-hand with community empowerment. After years of expedition work in West Papua's remote regions, our founders recognized that the traditional knowledge and stewardship of local communities are essential to long-term ecosystem protection.

---

### Our Mission
To protect marine biodiversity through community-led conservation that respects traditional governance, relies on rigorous science, and ensures lasting benefits for local communities.

---

### Our Vision
We envision a future where coastal communities across the Coral Triangle lead marine conservation efforts, managing thriving Marine Protected Areas that restore fish populations, protect coral reefs, and provide sustainable livelihoods for generations to come.

By proving this model works in Raja Ampat, we aim to inspire and support communities throughout Indonesia and beyond to take control of their marine future.

---

### Our Values

**Community First**
Every decision respects Free, Prior, and Informed Consent protocols. Communities lead, we support.

**Traditional Knowledge**
Integration of customary law (adat) with modern conservation. Traditional systems aren't obstacles—they're foundations.

**Scientific Rigor**
Evidence-based approaches with measurable outcomes. Quarterly monitoring tracks what's working.

**Transparency**
Open reporting and community-led governance. We publicly share monitoring data, financials, and decisions.

**Sustainability**
Long-term thinking for 30+ years of effective protection. We build capacity so conservation continues.

**Inclusivity**
Minimum 30% representation for women, youth, and diverse voices in all governance structures.

---

### Our Approach
We don't impose conservation from the outside. Instead, we work alongside local communities to strengthen their traditional management systems (sasi) while providing the tools, training, and resources needed for effective modern marine protection.

## PROJECT PAGE

### Hero Section
**Section Label:** PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Community-Led Marine Protected Area

**Subtitle:** Establishing a 250 km² no-take zone in Misool, Raja Ampat through traditional governance and modern conservation science

---

### The Vision
West Papua Care is establishing a groundbreaking community-led Marine Protected Area in Misool, Raja Ampat, Indonesia—the heart of the Coral Triangle and the most biodiverse marine ecosystem on Earth. This 250 km² no-take zone covers the islands and archipelagos of Damu, Canpade, Balbulol, Sagof, Efpian, Kasiah, and surrounding waters—an area twice the size of Paris city.

---

### Why Misool, Raja Ampat
Misool is a biodiversity hotspot within Raja Ampat, home to 75% of the world's coral species and over 1,600 fish species. Its fringing reefs, reef walls, atolls, off-shore reefs, caves and underwater rock formations host huge marine biodiversity including endemic and key species. It is an important spawning ground for corals and fishes.

The area faces serious threats from cyanide fishing, illegal fishers from as far as Sulawesi, sea turtle harvesting, shark finning, and past bomb fishing damage. With strong community consensus already secured and traditional leaders endorsing the project, we have a unique window of opportunity to protect this marine treasure before it's too late.

---

### Project Goals
- Establish 250 km² no-take zone Marine Protected Area with 10km buffer zone
- Restore traditional governance systems (adat/sasi) for marine management
- Target 50% increase in fish biomass within 5 years based on regional MPA performance data
- Protect key species: Napoleon wrasse, Hawksbill and Green sea turtles, Bumphead Parrotfish, and shark species
- Create sustainable livelihoods through ecotourism and resource management
- Conduct GPS-marked scientific surveys of coral health and ecosystem dynamics
- IUCN Red List species identification and conservation status tracking
- Establish base camp operations on Cempedak Island with ranger patrols
