### Hero Section
**Section Label:** [ OUR STORY ]

**Title:** Rooted in Community, Driven by Science

**Subtitle:** Building a new model for marine conservation that empowers local communities and protects the world's most biodiverse reefs

---

### Content

#### Our Origin Story
West Papua Care was founded in 2024 by conservationists and community organizers who witnessed firsthand the failures of top-down marine protection. Time and again, we saw Marine Protected Areas established without genuine community consent, leading to conflict, poor compliance, and ultimately unsuccessful conservation.

We knew there had to be a better way—one that respected traditional governance, secured authentic community ownership, and delivered measurable conservation outcomes. Raja Ampat, with its exceptional biodiversity and strong traditional leadership, provided the perfect opportunity to demonstrate this alternative model.

#### Our Mission
To protect marine biodiversity through community-led conservation that respects traditional governance, relies on rigorous science, and ensures lasting benefits for local communities.

#### Our Vision
We envision a future where coastal communities across the Coral Triangle lead marine conservation efforts, managing thriving Marine Protected Areas that restore fish populations, protect coral reefs, and provide sustainable livelihoods for generations to come.

By proving this model works in Raja Ampat, we aim to inspire and support communities throughout Indonesia and beyond to take control of their marine future.

#### Our Values

**Community Ownership**
Local communities must have genuine decision-making power, not just consultation. We follow rigorous FPIC protocols and ensure community voices drive all major decisions.

**Evidence-Based Practice**
Science guides our approach. Quarterly monitoring tracks what's working and what isn't, allowing us to adapt and improve based on real data, not assumptions.

**Long-Term Sustainability**
We build local capacity and sustainable financing so conservation continues after external support ends. Our goal is to become unnecessary.

**Transparency & Accountability**
We publicly share monitoring data, financial reports, and governance decisions. Transparency builds trust with communities and donors alike.

**Cultural Respect**
Traditional governance systems like adat and sasi aren't obstacles—they're foundations. We integrate customary law with modern MPA structures.

**Scalable Impact**
While focused on Raja Ampat, we're building a replicable model that communities across the Coral Triangle and beyond can adapt to their contexts.

#### Why Raja Ampat
Raja Ampat isn't just stunningly beautiful—it's irreplaceable. As the global epicenter of marine biodiversity, protecting these reefs protects the genetic library for the world's coral ecosystems. Yet this treasure faces mounting threats: destructive fishing, illegal harvesting, and weakening traditional management.

What made Raja Ampat the right place to start was the combination of exceptional biodiversity, strong traditional governance structures, and communities ready to lead. After two years of relationship-building and consultations, we achieved strong consensus across 10+ villages to establish community-led protection.

#### Our Approach
We don't come with pre-made solutions. Instead, we facilitate a process where communities define their own vision for marine protection, informed by scientific evidence and successful examples from elsewhere. We provide:

- Technical expertise in reef monitoring and MPA design
- Facilitation of inclusive governance structures
- Training in Reef Check survey methods
- Support accessing funding and partnerships
- Documentation and sharing of lessons learned

But communities make the decisions. They set boundaries, determine rules, manage budgets, and enforce compliance. Our role is to support, not direct.

#### Looking Forward
Our immediate priority is securing official government designation for the MPA while maintaining strong community buy-in and documenting early signs of ecosystem recovery. Over the next 5 years, we aim to:

- Achieve measurable increases in fish biomass and coral cover
- Establish sustainable financing through ecotourism revenue
- Support 3-5 additional communities in establishing their own MPAs
- Publish peer-reviewed research on community-led conservation effectiveness
- Build a regional network of community-managed MPAs

## APPROACH PAGE

### Hero Section
**Section Label:** [ OUR APPROACH ]

**Title:** Community-Led Conservation Grounded in Science

**Subtitle:** Building marine protection on trust, accountability, and indigenous knowledge

---

### Content

**Intro:**
West Papua Care's approach places local communities at the heart of marine conservation, guided by scientific evidence and rooted in traditional knowledge. We're building a model where communities don't just participate in conservation—they lead it.

#### Core Principles
As an inception-stage project, we're guided by principles rather than rigid processes. This allows us to remain adaptive, learn as we go, and ensure our approach truly serves both the ecosystem and the communities who depend on it.

**Community Leadership**
Local voices drive all decisions. We follow Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) protocols, ensuring communities fully understand the project and retain the power to say no. This isn't consultation—it's genuine partnership where communities hold decision-making authority.

- Traditional leaders (kepala suku) guide direction and provide cultural authority
- MPA Committee includes diverse representation: women, youth, fishers, and elders
- Village meetings determine resource use boundaries and protection rules
- Community patrols led by local fishers who know these waters intimately

**Science-Backed**
Effective conservation requires evidence. We use internationally recognized Reef Check monitoring protocols to track coral health, fish populations, and ecosystem recovery. But science serves the community—not the other way around.

- Quarterly monitoring at GPS-marked sites provides consistent data
- Local fishers trained as citizen scientists, building capacity and ownership
- Data guides adaptive management—if something isn't working, we adjust
- Monitoring tracks spillover benefits to adjacent fishing areas
- IUCN Red List species identification ensures protection of threatened populations

**Trust & Accountability**
Conservation succeeds when communities trust the process and see genuine accountability. We're building systems that are transparent, inclusive, and responsive to community needs and concerns.

- Regular community meetings where decisions are explained and feedback heard
- Transparent reporting on finances, monitoring results, and challenges faced
- MPA Committee accountable to communities, not external funders
- Conflict resolution starts with traditional mediation before formal processes
- Success measured by community wellbeing alongside ecological metrics

**Indigenous in Decision-Making**
Raja Ampat communities have managed these waters for centuries through traditional systems called sasi and adat. We don't replace these systems—we strengthen them and integrate them with modern conservation tools.

- Traditional governance structures provide cultural legitimacy
- Customary law incorporated into protection rules and enforcement
- Elders guide seasonal closures and identify sacred sites
- Indigenous knowledge about fish behavior and reef health informs monitoring
- Decision-making follows traditional consensus-building (musyawarah)

#### Community Benefits
Marine protection isn't just about conservation—it's about improving community livelihoods and wellbeing. When communities benefit, conservation lasts.

**Spillover Effect**
Fish populations in the no-take zone spill into surrounding fishing areas, increasing catches by up to 50%. Healthier reefs mean better fishing for everyone.

**Ecotourism Revenue**
Pristine reefs attract divers and tourists, creating sustainable income opportunities for guides, homestays, and local businesses.

**Education & Training**
Since March 2024, we've supported English classes, TOEFL preparation, paid internships in Bali, and student exchanges to enhance job readiness.

**Employment Priority**
Local community members fill all suitable positions, with minimum 30% representation of women, youth, or individuals with disabilities.

**Food Security**
Healthy reefs ensure long-term protein supply for future generations. Conservation is about sustaining the resources families depend on.

**Cultural Pride**
Communities recognized as global leaders in marine stewardship, preserving their heritage while protecting their future.

#### Adaptive & Evaluative
As an early-stage project, we embrace learning and adaptation. We're guided by principles and evidence, not rigid procedures. This evaluative approach means we:

- Regularly assess what's working and what isn't through community feedback and monitoring data
- Adjust strategies based on evidence and community needs
- Document lessons learned—both successes and failures—to improve and share
- Prioritize relationship-building over bureaucratic processes
- Remain flexible enough to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities
- Evaluate progress every 5 years with traditional authorities and community representatives

#### Building for the Long Term
Our goal isn't to create dependency but to build local capacity for communities to manage the MPA themselves. We invest in training, support sustainable financing through ecotourism and conservation fees, and strengthen traditional governance structures.

This isn't charity—it's building the institutional and financial foundation for conservation that lasts 30+ years.

#### Base Camp Operations
Rangers operate from Cempedak Island, equipped with a 100 HP speedboat, surveillance drones, mobile Starlink internet, and accommodation facilities. Community members with traditional land rights retain access while respecting conservation protocols.

#### Our Commitment
We commit to conservation that respects community autonomy, adapts based on evidence, operates with transparency, and measures success by both ecological recovery and community prosperity. When ecosystems and people both thrive, conservation becomes self-sustaining.

**Title:** Measuring What Matters

**Subtitle:** Tracking ecological recovery, community benefits, and long-term sustainability through rigorous monitoring

---

### Content

#### Our Impact Framework
Conservation impact extends beyond protecting coral reefs—it includes improving community livelihoods, strengthening traditional governance, and building local capacity for long-term stewardship. We track progress across three interconnected dimensions: ecological health, community wellbeing, and institutional sustainability.

#### Ecological Impact
Through quarterly Reef Check surveys at 15 monitoring sites, we track key indicators of ecosystem recovery and health. While our MPA is still in early implementation, baseline data establishes benchmarks for measuring future progress.

**Coral Cover (Baseline):** 42%
- Target: 55%+ by 2030
- Current cover is good but shows declining trend from historical highs

**Fish Biomass (Baseline):** 185 g/m²
- Target: 350+ g/m² by 2030
- Well below healthy reef levels; significant room for recovery

**Indicator Species:** 67%
- Target: 90%+ by 2030
- Key species present but at reduced abundance; recruitment ongoing

#### Expected Recovery Timeline
Based on successful MPAs in similar contexts, we anticipate:

- **Years 1-2:** Fish populations begin recovering, especially fast-growing species
- **Years 3-5:** Visible biomass increase, larger fish return, spillover effects measurable
- **Years 5-10:** Coral cover increases, ecosystem complexity restored, threatened species return
- **Years 10+:** Ecosystem reaches new equilibrium, resilience to disturbances enhanced

#### Community Impact
Marine protection succeeds when communities benefit tangibly from conservation. We track multiple indicators of community wellbeing and livelihood improvement.

**Economic Benefits**
- 10+ villages engaged in MPA governance
- Ecotourism revenue sharing framework established
